# Create a GUI with python and QT
## tools
python PyQt5

## Principles of learning
(1) find a demo that can open the camera and show captures in a window.

(2) figure out the details of the code

(3) modified it to adapt to my needs


## process
pip install PyQt5

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel

just like C++

### main code structure
mainly depends on a class that derives from the QtWidgets.QWidget.

In the main function of the Qt

there are 4 very important lines.

    App = QApplication(sys.argv)
    win = Ui_MainWindow()
    win.show()
    sys.exit(App.exec_())

the 1st one is to initialize an application.

the 2nd one is to declare the window

the 3rd one is to make the window shown

the 4th one is to make sure when I want exit the app I can, make it


### steps

firstly, we should make it clear that what are the key points of this programme.

1. the button that open the camera.
2. the captured image(sent to the DNN)
2. how to put the output image in the window.

## error
after putting the model in "show_camera", there's an AssertError when predicting. 

it's because there's code in predict.py that tried to load the json file, but I don't have it. So there's error happend, just comment these lines. Then programme words well.

**Things to Learn: **

When meet some error that gives no log.</br> 
just use debug mode in Pycharm
