something to notice:

when input "Get-WindowsCapability -name openssh.server* -online"

see error1 in terminal, there is "'Get-WindowsCapability' 不是内部或外部命令...."

the pipelie in the blog above fails

so try another one(when looking up in google, specifiy win10 pro)

in site [8 Replies to “Install OpenSSH on Windows 10 using PowerShell”](https://jcutrer.com/windows/install-openssh-on-windows10) 

when install Openssh in apps, it's done

## error
### 1 in terminal, there is "'Get-WindowsCapability' 不是内部或外部命令.

follow the hint here [Get-Windowsfeature missing???](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/Lync/en-US/35330530-0488-4ddc-8544-6f95cec51abc/getwindowsfeature-missing?forum=win10itprogeneral)

this is a command only in windows server, not in desktop versions

can use "dism /online /get-features " to replace it

but this can't work, there is another error, see error2

### 2 DISM 未识别命令行选项“openssh.server*”。
I guese this pipeline only works in windows server, so I gave it up.
